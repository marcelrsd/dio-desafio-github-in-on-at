In, On or At GitHub?


Is there any rule for choose one preposition?

My project is in /on/ at GitHub?

1) Most references use "on" GitHub: For instance, the git repository is hosted on GitHub and the code is hosted on GitHub.

2) GitHub is a container: a reasonable use for "on". 

3) GitHub is considered a platform also: "on" that platform.

What do you thing about it?
